We both equally contributed to this assignment
We both brainstormed and planned out assignment 4.
We both planned out implementation for all methods.
We both worked very closely to ensure there was equal contribution on assignment 4.

to compile:
javac *.java -d bin


to run:
java -cp bin Orji_Patel_assignment4.SortDriver <input file name>

To run experiment 2:
As stated in the menu simply type "rand" to use a random array
* note that you would have to manually change the size of the array on the last else-if of the driver class
* Also if you try to run experiment 2 on quick-sort-fp with size 20,000 or above it will produce a runtime-error
